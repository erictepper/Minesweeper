# Minesweeper
A from-scratch Java implementation of Minesweeper, taking advantage of the java.awt.Graphics library. 
Class code can be found in [../src](../src)

Potential future features include:
* Create an option within the app to start a new game (rather than having to restart the app entirely).
* Reveal all bombs upon losing the game.
* Multiple game sizes (i.e. small, medium, and large).
